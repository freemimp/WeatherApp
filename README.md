### Weather app

#### Please note
In order for google maps to work you need to add `MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key` in to `local.properties`

#### Work done
- Architecture MVVM with coroutines and live data
- splitting app in to data, domain and ui layers
- using Hilt, Moshi and Jetpack Navigation, Mockk, JUnit5 among other things
- I done all bonuses: weather icons, simple icon caching, forecast for users current location and opening map for user's current location
- Unit and UI tests
